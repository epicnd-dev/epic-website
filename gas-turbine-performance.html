Members of the team will use data science, machine learning, and knowledge of thermodynamics to build and optimize their model.
                    <br><br>
                    Project goals include understanding how a combined cycle power plant works, developing models to predict energy output and harmful emissions, and determining if it is possible for such power plants to be carbon neutral.
                    <br><br>
                    The project begins early March and lasts through spring semester for a duration of approximately 10-12 weeks. The first one or two weeks will serve as an introduction to gas turbines and how combined cycle power plants operate. Thereafter, the team will work on building its model through combined effort and knowledge from its members’ majors and meet with GE for guidance and evaluation throughout the semester. We also aim to provide opportunities for the team to give presentations and write small technical memorandums, culminating in a final presentation at the end of the semester; this will allow students to build both technical writing and presentation skills on top of the engineering skills they will acquire from the creation of the model. Members are asked to commit 3-5 hours per week as they work with an interdisciplinary team of engineers. </p>
